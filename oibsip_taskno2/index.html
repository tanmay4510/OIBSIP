            <h2>About Stephen Hawking</h2>
            <img src="Stephen_Hawking.StarChild.jpg" alt="image not found">
            <p>Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 â€“ 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist,
                cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for
                Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.[7][17][18] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the
                Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most
                prestigious academic posts in the world.

                Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his
                university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in
                physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge
                where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics,
                specializing in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an
                early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed
                him.[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially
                through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.
